# Final-Degree-Project
Language : Catalan                  Format: PDF  The age of digitalization has changed how we read and more importantly, how books are written.  This project explains and provides methods in which one can publish their work of art ( book, photography, etc) by themselves at a fair price and without losing on quality.  I have created a publishing company aimed at helping novice writers, which gives them all the power to decide what to do with their work. This has proven to be a major problem in the system, where the real geniuses do not get enough for their work.
